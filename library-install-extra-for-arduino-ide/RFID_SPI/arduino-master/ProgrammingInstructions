Programming Instructions


Compiling in Arduino for .hex file:

OSX - /var/folders/xt/rdm...gn/T/build.....tmp/....hex
(seen by turning on verbose output during compilation)
Delete .o files from this directory of what you want re-compiled, or delete the whole build directory and re-open Arduino.


Copy to Ninja Block:

scp .hex file to ninjablock /opt/utilities/tmp/arduino.hex


Perform the install:

(Note: arduino.hex will be deleted when completed)
sudo stop ninjablock
update_arduino
sudo start ninjablock
