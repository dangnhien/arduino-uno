15th July 2013 by jz
	- made copy for RPi arduino crust (originally NinjaObjects.cpp)

8th October 2012 by JP Liew
	- added doWT450()to decode house, station, humidity & temp from raw data

2nd October 2012 by JP Liew
	- added TESTER code for Ninja Cape to test another fresh cape out from production
	- added DID 8888,8889,8890 to support special command for TESTER to send/receive signal

24th August 2012 by JP Liew
	- added RGB Status light support
	- added DID 999 for V12 status RGB
	- added PLUGIN and UNPLUG events
	- changed doJSONData() to support, DEVICE, PLUGIN and UNPLUG event in one function
	- changed sensor to only send on changed event, except Distance, Light and Sound
	- changed Light sensor to report value from 0% to 100%, in a 10 average reading

20th August 2012 by JP Liew
	- changed doOnBoardRGB(), doOnBoardTemperature(), doDHT22() to slow down to 30 seconds per update
	- changed doDHT22() to continue poll data when first plugin until valid before obeying the heartbeat delay
	- tidied doPort1(), doPort2() and doPort3() when dealing with DHT22
	- disabled DHT22 from sending -99 or 0
	- cleaned commented codes
	- enabled accelerometer for V11 after testing
	- split do433() into GUID=0 and GUID=1 for V12 and V11 respectively
	
17th August 2012 by JP Liew
	- added support for LaCrosse WS2355 protocol for emp, humidity, rain, wind, win direction
	- added support for LaCrosse TX3 protocol for temp
	- changed do433() in ordered to use the same routine for V11 and V12
	- disabled do433() from sending -1 result
	
14th August 2012 by JP Liew
	- added doJSONData(...) to allow easier calling of the library
	- clean up many precompile warnings
	- added V11 V12 preprocessor directives for version selection
	- changed doOnBoardRGB() to cater PWM for V12 board
	- added doOnBoard433() for V12 board

30th July 2012 by JP Liew
	- fixed RCSwitch to add leading zeros when sending JSON data in binary
	- fixed GREEN LED blink on GREEN when receiving 433 data

5th July 2012 by JP Liew
	- added Device ID 1003, DATA="VNO" for cape to report software version
	- disabled responding to DID 1001 with the new all in one TX & RX board
	- changed 433 transmit from 5 times to 8 times

2nd July 2012 by JP Liew
	- added handling for Relay Breakout board
	
15th June 2012 by JP Liew
	- added doOnBoardRGB() to return RGB status
	- added doJSONResponse() to ack actuator messages
	- added doJSONError(int) to report error
	
1st June 2012 by JP Liew
	- fixed readSerialString() stucked in while loop
	- changed blinkGreenLED() to blinkLED() so that any LED could be blinked

31st May 2012 by JP Liew
	- added 433Mhz Rx module code.  NOTE: Receiver only works on PORT 1, utilising INT1 of ATMEGA328.
	- added blinkGreenLED() when valid 433Mhz code received.

30th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- changed DHT22 Humidity & Temp to return float value

29th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- added 433Mhz Tx module code
  
28th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- JSON protocol shorten to G,V,D,DA
	- fixed RGB ID bug, should be 1000
	- added return ID PIN Value if sensor UNKNOWN
		
25th May 2012 by JP Liew
	- restructure JSON protocol to encapsulate devices with GUID, VID, DID and DATA

5th May 2012 by JP Liew 
	- moved to NinjaObjects library
	- added doReactors
